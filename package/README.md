# gvwire-election-results
System for automatically pulling and displaying local and state election results.

# To Deploy:
Copy and paste the files in the package folder to the destination directory on the server. Navigate to the folder through SSH and start the python process - this is an important step, as the original data directory is empty and running the process verifies that everything works properly. The package should only contain minified versions of the JS and CSS.
